### A little Prolog-Parser

This is a rewrite of the excellent generator-driven Prolog-Parser [blog & discussion](https://curiosity-driven.org/prolog-interpreter) by github-user __curiosity-driven__ [1].
The Parser and the Interpreter are rewritten in CoffeeScript.
A second parser was done using Michal Srb's _Meta-Coffee_ [2]. Meta-Coffee is a implementation of Alexandro Warth & Ian Piumarta OMeta-Project [3]. It uses CoffeeScript as a host-language. So that one can write _Semantic Actions_ [4] in CS.
The hand-written Prolog-Parser is included in `src/js/parser.js`. As straight-forward as it is, i believe using the grammar-approach it might be easier to add predicates in the future.

This grammar drives the second version of the Prolog-Parser :

@import "./src/LittlePrologGrammar.mc" { as="coffee" line_begin=46 }


##### install 
```
git clone 
```

##### build & run
```
# to build source & grammar
cake all
# to rebuild the grammar
cake grammar

# then 
node ./index.js
# or 
npm run demo
```

This will run the [zebra-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle). It is included in all three parser-implementations.
